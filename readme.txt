How to Run the Program:
Extract the VideoShorts.zip archive to any folder on your computer (e.g., on the Desktop).
Open the folder, and you will see a file named youtubescript.exe.
Double-click youtubescript.exe—a black window (terminal) will open.
Enter the YouTube video URL when prompted (copy the link from your browser).
Enter the watermark text (e.g., @MyName) or simply press Enter to use the default one.
Wait while the program processes the video—your shorts will appear in the shorts_videos folder next to the .exe file.
If something doesn't work, let me know!

If You Still Don’t Get It:
INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING THE SCRIPT
Download and extract the folder I sent you.
Open the folder and find the file named "youtubescript" (without the .py extension).
Double-click the file to run the script.
If nothing happens or an error appears, message me, and I'll help!
If you're on Windows and the file doesn't run, you might need to allow execution:
Right-click the file → Properties → Check "Allow execution" → Click OK.
